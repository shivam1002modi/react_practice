✅ Plan for You
Start with React basics → Components, JSX, Props, State.

Hands-on small projects while learning each concept.

Gradually move to Hooks, Routing, API calls, and State Management.

Build 1 intermediate project and 1 advanced project.

We’ll cover:

Installing Node.js and create-react-app (or Vite for faster dev).

Project structure (public vs src).
